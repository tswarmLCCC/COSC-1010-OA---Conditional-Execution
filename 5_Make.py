# Graded Assignment: The Python Sorting Hat

## Problem Description

Welcome to the CodeMagic Academy! Every new student must be sorted into one of four houses. You have been tasked with creating a Python program that acts as a simple Sorting Hat. The program will ask the user a single question and, based on their answer, assign them to a house.

The sorting criteria are as follows:

* **Gryffindor:** If the user answers "adventure".
* **Hufflepuff:** If the user answers "loyalty".
* **Ravenclaw:** If the user answers "wisdom".
* **Slytherin:** If the user answers "ambition".
* If the user enters anything else, they are a "Muggle" and cannot be sorted.

Your program should be user-friendly, prompt the user clearly, and print their assigned house in a welcoming message.

## Expected Input/Output

Your program should ask the user one question. The interaction should look like the examples below.

**Example 1:**

```
What quality do you value most: adventure, loyalty, wisdom, or ambition?
> wisdom
Welcome to Ravenclaw!
```

**Example 2:**

```
What quality do you value most: adventure, loyalty, wisdom, or ambition?
> power
Sorry, you cannot be sorted. You must be a Muggle.
```

## Requirements

1.  Create one variable to store the user's input.
2.  Use an `if-elif-else` structure to check the user's answer.
3.  Print the correct house name or the "Muggle" message based on the input.
4.  Make sure your code is clean, well-commented, and follows Python style standards.

## Hints

* Remember that the `input()` function returns a string.
* The comparison `==` is used to check if two strings are identical.
* Think about what should happen in the `else` blockâ€”this is the "catch-all" for any answer that doesn't match the four houses.

## Stretch Goals (Optional)

* Modify the program to ignore the case of the user's input. For example, "Adventure", "adventure", and "ADVENTURE" should all result in being sorted into Gryffindor. (Hint: Look up string methods like `.lower()`).
* Add a second question and combine the conditions. For example, you could ask about a favorite animal and use an `and` operator to make the sorting more complex.
